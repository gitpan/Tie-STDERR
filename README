			Readme for Tie::STDERR
		--------------------------------------

If you use the line

	use Tie::STDERR;

at the start of your script (and maybe CGI script), any output that
would go to STDERR will be sent by email to root. You can specify the
recipient, for example

	use Tie::STDERR 'adelton';

would send the message to me.

Alternatively, you can pipe the output to some other process or append
the output to some file:

	use Tie::STDERR '| logger ...';
	
	use Tie::STDERR '>> /tmp/testing.log';

The module will catch all output, including your explicit prints to
STDERR, warnings about undefined values, dies and even dies as
a result of compilation error. You do not need any special
treatment/functions -- Tie::STDERR will catch all.

Warning for now:
	Nor the name nor the functionality has yet been cleared with
	other people from the Perl community -- if you like the
	module, please let me (or c.l.p.misc) know.

	CPAN site in the authors/id/JANPAZ/ directory.
